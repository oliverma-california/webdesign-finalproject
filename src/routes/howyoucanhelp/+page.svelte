      <div class="text-2xl text-start align-text-top py-5">
        By switching to reusable products, you greatly reduce your consumption and ecological footprint by not having to replace your items. You can also greatly reduce the amount of waste that you produce since the products will no longer be disposed of after each use, which also lessens your impact on global pollution.<br>Examples are:
        <ul class="list-disc pl-10">
          <li>Using paper or metal straws instead of plastic straws.</li>
          <li>Using reusable totes instead of plastic bags.</li>
          <li>Using a water filter and reusable water bottles instead of plastic water bottles.</li>

        More and more brands are beginning to emerge that offer eco-friendly or biodegradable products that are not harmful to produce and/or will decompose upon disposal, mitigating the problem of waste and pollution. In addition, many existing brands are also beginning to offer these kinds of eco-friendly products. It is now easier than ever to replace the items in your daily life with high-quality and affordable products from reputable brands.

        This video addresses the issue that only a small subset of people will be able to make radical changes to their daily living to significantly cut down on their waste production. It outlines smaller but still impactful changes that are practical to a greater number of people and still represent a big overall positive impact on waste reduction.
